In the meadow where the daisies bloom,        
Underneath the silver moon’s soft gloom,        
A stream flows gently, whispering slow,           
Carrying secrets only the earth would know.        

The stars above in quiet grace,          
Twinkle like gems in a velvet space.          
The night is calm, the air is still,          
Except for the owl’s distant trill.          

The fireflies dance in glowing light,         
As shadows stretch and blend with night.         
A breeze sweeps in, cool and serene,        
Weaving through the branches green.        

The flowers sway in rhythmic time,         
As crickets sing their evening rhyme.         
The world seems paused in gentle peace,          
As worries of the day release.         

In this quiet, hearts are free,           
Embraced by nature’s harmony.            
Time flows gently, like a stream,          
Lost within a tranquil dream.
