## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves         
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;            
All mimsy were the borogoves,               
And the mome raths outgrabe.                
Beware the Jabberwock, my son!              

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Whose woods these are I think I know.       
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here               
To watch his woods fill up with snow.            
My little horse must think it queer           

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

The sun was shining on the sea,       
Shining with all his might:     
He did his very best to make       
The billows smooth and bright—       
And this was odd, because it was     
The middle of the night.     

The moon was shining sulkily        
Because she thought the sun       
Had got no business to be there      
After the day was done.       
“It’s very rude of him,” she said,      
“To come and spoil the fun.”        

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In the meadow where the daisies bloom,        
Underneath the silver moon’s soft gloom,        
A stream flows gently, whispering slow,           
Carrying secrets only the earth would know.        

The stars above in quiet grace,          
Twinkle like gems in a velvet space.          
The night is calm, the air is still,          
Except for the owl’s distant trill.          

The fireflies dance in glowing light,         
As shadows stretch and blend with night.         
A breeze sweeps in, cool and serene,        
Weaving through the branches green.        

The flowers sway in rhythmic time,         
As crickets sing their evening rhyme.         
The world seems paused in gentle peace,          
As worries of the day release.         

In this quiet, hearts are free,           
Embraced by nature’s harmony.            
Time flows gently, like a stream,          
Lost within a tranquil dream.
